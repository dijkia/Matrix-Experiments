enables the experiments tab in discord's settings and makes your client think you are an "admin" (this requires a modified client like betterdiscord). discord will also disable some of the experiments through the api, so that means some will not work. be careful with what you do; you can be banned. if you get banned, that's your own fault. and if it doesn't work for you, then that sucks for you because i'm not helping you.
